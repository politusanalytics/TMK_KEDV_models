# TMK KEDV Models
This repo includes the required code for running the trained models used for Oxfam project.

We firstly run the earthquake relevant model on the tweets to see if its about earthquake or not. Later we run the aid relevant model. Lastly we run the aid sub-class model to classify the relevant earthquake aid activity. Those models are running on the tweets. 

After identifying all of the relevant tweets, we got the users of those tweets and run organization relevant model.
